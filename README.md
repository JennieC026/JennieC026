##About me

üëã Hi there! I'm Jennie Chen.

üöÄ I'm a passionate programmer who found my true calling in coding, a journey that commenced with winning second place in a primary school programming competition. Despite facing societal barriers discouraging women from pursuing STEM, I persevered.

üè´ After putting my love for coding on hold, I took an academic detour in Concept Design at ArtCenter College of Design. While enriching, it reaffirmed that my heart was truly in technology.

üë©‚Äçüíª Fueled by this realization, I jumped back into programming through a 6-month intensive bootcamp at App Academy. Specializing in algorithms and data structures, I found myself engrossed in problem-solving and debugging, relishing the challenges and triumphs that come with it.

üé® My background in design has added a unique flair to my projects, allowing me to create user-centric and visually appealing solutions.
